# Recruiting Linklist

Inspired by [Sjamilla's](https://github.com/Sjamilla) awesome [awesome-recruitment repository](https://github.com/Sjamilla/awesome-recruitment) I plan on making all my collected links to tools, blogs, newsletter etc. public for everyone who cares. 

Ongoing project with regular updates.
